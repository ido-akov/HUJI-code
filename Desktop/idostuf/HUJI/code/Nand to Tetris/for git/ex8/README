ASM template files:

add.asm - ASM code to pop top two stack entries, add them and push back result
and.asm - ASM code to pop top two stack entries, and them and push back result
bootstrap.asm - ASM to set Stack Pointer to 256, afterwards we call Sys.init 0
call.asm - ASM code to call a function
eq.asm - ASM code to pop top two stack entries, check if equal and push back 0 (false)
or -1 (true)
function.asm - ASM code to initiate a function
goto.asm - ASM code to goto a VM label unconditionally
gt.asm - ASM code to pop top two stack entries, check if second greater than first, 
 and push back 0 (false) or -1 (true)
if-goto.asm - ASM code to goto a VM label conditionally
label.asm - ASM code for a new label
lt.asm - ASM code to pop top two stack entries, check if second less than first, 
and push back 0 (false) or -1 (true)
neg.asm - ASM code to pop top stack entry, negate and push back result
not.asm - ASM code to pop top stack entry, bitwise not it and push back result
or.asm - ASM code to pop top two stack entries, or them and push back result
pop.asm - ASM code to pop from stack into local/argument/this/that memory segment
pop_pointer.asm - ASM code to pop from stack into pointer memory segment
pop_static.asm - ASM code to pop from stack into static memory segment
pop_temp.asm - ASM code to pop from stack into temp memory segment
push.asm - ASM code to push into stack from local/argument/this/that memory segment
push_constant.asm - ASM code to push into stack from constant memory segment
push_pointer.asm - ASM code to push into stack from pointer memory segment
push_static.asm - ASM code to push into stack from static memory segment
push_temp.asm - ASM code to push into stack from temp memory segment
return.asm - ASM code to return from a function, set back stack to previous condition
sub.asm - ASM code to pop top two stack entries, subtract first from second and push back result

Remarks
-------
Hot damn! Good exercise. We had some nice, intelligent debugging sessions
