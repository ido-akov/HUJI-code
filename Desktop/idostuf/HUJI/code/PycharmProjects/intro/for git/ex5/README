I separated the function find_words_in_matrix to the following functions: 

search_loop- which designates for each direction how to search through the matrix, and updated the values of words found in the word dictionary

compare_words, which does the actual comparing to the list of words using the function get_all_substrings(): which returns all possible sub-strings forwards

the actual searches are done using three different functions:

down_search: which basically inverts the matrix up to down and returns a list with columns as rows

reverse: which reverses the matrix right to left

diagonal_search: which makes use of the helper-function: 
get_rows: which returns a replica of the original matrix

find_words_in_matrix itself finally creates the word dictionary and updates according the searches done. It returns only those items with a value of larger than 0. 

For my checking function I used down_search, with the cases [], [[‘a’],[‘b’],[‘c’],[‘d’]],[[‘a’,’b’,’c’,’d’],[‘a’,’b’,’c’,’d’]].
I chose the first for an empty matrix, t
