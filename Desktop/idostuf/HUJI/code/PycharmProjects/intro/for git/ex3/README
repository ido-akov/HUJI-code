I discussed function 7 (primes factors) with Nadav Azarzar

README for ex03

Description: 
for part 4 I chose the following test cases: [1.00, 1, 1.001, 1.01], [.99, .98, 1.0, 1], [2 ** 0.5, 239 / 169], [1, 1, 1, 1].
The first has very similar values with a float being the maximum,
the second similar values with an int being the maximum, 
the third extremely close values both being floats, the one an approximation of an irrational number, 
and the last test case has all similar values. 

Part 5:
1. cyclic(123 ,321) returns TypeError, because an int object has no len
2. maximum([-3, -2, -1]) returns -1, because function can compare negatives
3. maximum([1, 10, 100, ‘intro’]) returns 100, because the function overlooks non-int types
4. histogram(3, [1,2,3,4]) returns [0, 1, 1], because 1, 2 each appear once within the num_list
5. prime_factors(0) returns [], because the condition for the while loop isn’t met, meaning an empty list is returned
6. pairs([0,0,1,1,2,2], 2) returns [[0,2], [1,1]] because all permutations aren’t added onto the list
